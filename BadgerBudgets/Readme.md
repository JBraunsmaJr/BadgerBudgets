# Badger Budgets

### Summary

One of many budgeting applications out there in the ether. The primary objective of this application was for me to
export financial data from different sources then import them into an app where I can make sense of it all.

1. I didn't want third party software connecting to things.
2. Ability to map columns from CSV files into columns the app understands/looks for.
3. Ability to apply transforms on data, or conditionally change a column based on value in another column.
4. Provide various data views, tables, and charts.
